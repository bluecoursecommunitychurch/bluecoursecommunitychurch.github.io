Core ministries for Sunday morning services and all through the week

## Prayer

At Blue Course Community Church, we want to promote corporate and personal prayer. We believe prayer is simply talking with 
the God of the Bible. That’s it. Through Christ’s sacrifice on the cross, we can come boldly before Him. (Hebrews 4:16) What 
an awesome privilege we have to lift prayer requests before God’s throne!

So why pray? Prayer deepens our relationship with Jesus, shows our dependency on God, gives us the opportunity to intercede 
for others (1 Timothy 2:1), and it is a weapon against the spiritual forces of darkness (Ephesians 6).

Corporate and one-on-one prayer times are offered after our Sunday services, facilitated by some of our lay-leaders who 
are passionate about prayer.

## Worship

The Worship Team leads the congregation in worship through song with the goal of helping the congregation connect with God in 
a meaningful way and to equip the church body to experience heartfelt worship. 

We are always looking to grow our team whether you are a vocalist or an instrumentalist. Please feel free to contact our 
worship director, Chris Beers, if this is a desire God has placed on your heart.
