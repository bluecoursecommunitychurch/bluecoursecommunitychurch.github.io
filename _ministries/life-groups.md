God desires all believers to experience the Life He offers. A significant part of that Life comes through relationships 
with others in the Body.

If you are not currently involved in a Life group we would love to invite you.

* Loving one another through authentic community. 
* Interaction with God through spiritual growth. 
* Fellowship with each other to build relationships.
* Evangelism to others as an overflow of a healthy spiritual life.

### A Life Group is a group of people who love God, His family, and His mission as they together experience the life-changing message of the Gospel. 

Life groups help provide an environment where people can develop life-giving relationships through love, care, discussion, 
fellowship, study, prayer, and service. They provide the relational connection people need to feel like they belong at Blue 
Course Community Church. 

They provide an opportunity to serve individually or as a team. Life groups are "safe places" where people can be authentic, 
know they are accepted and believed in, but also challenged and helped to grow.
