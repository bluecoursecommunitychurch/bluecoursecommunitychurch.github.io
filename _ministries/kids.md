Our mission as a **family-focused church** is to join parents in teaching their children the whole gospel of Jesus Christ and 
to assist parents in training their children to worship corporately as a part of our Blue Course Community family.

We strive toward this by providing a safe, kid-friendly environment for children to grow closer to Jesus and His church.

We hope to help children learn how to live in a way that shines Jesus’ light in their homes, schools, and the world in which 
they live.

Please feel free to contact [Cindy Rutschky](/team/cindy/) with any questions. 

### Nursery & Toddlers

We currently offer a nursery for infants, toddlers and preschoolers up to five years old during our Equipping the Saints 
time at 9:00 am.  

Then we have Nursery for infants at 10:30 am during worship.  After the beginning songs, the children are dismissed and we 
offer children’s church for Toddlers, Preschoolers and Elementary children.

The Nursery is staffed with at least two volunteers at all times, and all of our volunteers have gone through background 
checks and screenings. 

In the Nursery/Toddler room, we use A Sure Foundation Curriculum by Children Desiring God (now Truth78). 

In this material, the children build on the stories and truths introduced in the infant nursery through this curriculum, 
adding on nine more stories and truths about God.

If a problem may arise with their child, parents will be contacted during the service.

### Preschool and Elementary

After the children join the worship for the beginning songs they are dismissed for Children’s Church.  Currently we have a 
young group so Preschool and Elementary are combined.  Children hear a Christ-centered lesson, straight from the pages 
of scripture.  

Each week the children are greeted warmly by the teacher and assistant, participate in activities and crafts, memorize 
verses from the Bible, and go through a lesson that always helps them learn God’s Word and points them to Jesus.

We are currently using the curriculum from Children Desiring God, The ABC’s of God.

### HIS Kids Ministry Outreach

We have several outreaches throughout the year to glorify God and open our doors for children to share the love of Jesus 
with our community. 
 
The Blue Course Community Easter Egg Hunt offers a time of fellowship for our church families and the greater State 
College community as we celebrate the joy of Easter. We invite you to make it part of your family’s Easter celebration.

Our church has been participating in packing and sending the good news of Jesus along side gifts to children all over the 
world for many years. If you are not familiar with this ministry please visit the Operation Christmas Child website to 
learn more! Watch for sales year-round and purchase items we can use to pack boxes in the fall!
