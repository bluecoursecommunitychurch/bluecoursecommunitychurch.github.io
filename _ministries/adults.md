Blue Course Community Church's ministries to adult men and women

## Ministry to Women

Women’s Ministry serves all the women of Blue Course Community Church. We strive to provide ways for women to connect in 
life giving ways to each other through times of refreshment and fellowship and to God through Bible study and worship. We 
encourage growth in Christ like character and purpose with the desired result that we flow into the lives of others by giving 
of our time, talents, and gifts in ministry within our church, our homes, our workplaces, and our community.
 
#### Ways you can serve women at Blue Course Community:

Do you have the gift of teaching? We need Bible study facilitators. Training, coaching, and mentoring is available.

Do you have a heart for walking alongside women, helping them to grow in their walk with the Lord? We need disciplers/mentors. 
Training is available.

Do you love children? We need a childcare coordinator for the Wednesday morning Bible study. Background check and clearances 
are required, but can be provided through the church.

Do you have the gift of administration? We need help with the weekly logistics and coordination for the mid week Bible studies.

Do you have the gift of hospitality? We need a social events coordinator.

Gifts other than the ones mentioned above? We can use you to grow Women’s Ministry at Blue Course Community Church into all 
God intends it to be.

Child care usually provided

## Ministry to Men

Our vision is to help move men from an island mentality to a legacy mentality.
 
We want to investigate and go deeper as to what it means to be men of a legacy mentality in our homes, church and workplaces, 
as we study God’s Word.
 
The men’s ministry needs you and your gifts to complete the ministry God has prepared in advance for us.  Please join us. 
If you’d like more information, please contact any of our men’s ministry leadership team.
 
There are 2 sessions of Bagel Bunch, an early morning bible study/fellowship that meets at 6:30 am Mondays in the Community 
Room and 7:00 am every Wednesday via Zoom. We serve bagels and coffee, typically study a book of the Bible or other 
Christian books employing a voluntary rotation of participant leaders. Roll in, roll out as necessary.
There are also other special events such as hikes, Saturday breakfast seminars, PSU sports (wrestling matches & football 
watch parties are particularly popular), conferences, retreats, and service projects from time to time.
