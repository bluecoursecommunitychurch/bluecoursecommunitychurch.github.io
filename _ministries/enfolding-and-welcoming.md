At Blue Course Community Church, we strive to provide a warm welcome and help you connect with our community.

The Enfolding ministry encompasses a variety of functions, all with the goal of "enfolding" or integrating everyone into the Blue Course Community.

### Newcomers on Sundays are served by our teams of:
 
* **Greeters:** volunteers who share the joy of seeing and welcoming everyone at the door and information desk, especially our guests;

* **Frontlines:** volunteers who are available at the information table to answer questions.
 
* **Ushers:** volunteers make sure everyone has a bulletin, a place to sit, and help take us our offering to God;
 
* **Cafeâ€™ Connection:** volunteers that set up our coffee, tea and cocoa prior to the service.  This is a great time to mingle, 
chat and make new friends.
 
* **Cares and Concerns:** Volunteers who follow up with families that have a need, by making and delivering a meal. 

New attenders interested in membership can learn more about the history and ministries of Blue Course Community Church in the
