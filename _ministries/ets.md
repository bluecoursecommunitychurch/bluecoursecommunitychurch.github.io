Equipping the Saints (ETS) is a pre-service opportunity to encourage one another in spiritual growth. These sessions begin 
at 9 AM on Sundays.

How can we be “doers of the Word” and not just hearers? How can we live out our faith in our everyday lives? Equipping the 
Saints is designed to give you the skills and principles you need to do just that through interaction and an emphasis on 
application. A guiding passage for our time is found in Ephesians 4:11-16.

## Spring 2023

### Equipping the Next Generation by Ryan Cummins

This session will be aimed at how we can pass along the faith that has been entrusted with us to our children and grandchildren. 
The time will be structured around discussion of thoughtful talks and articles so that we can mutually encourage one another 
in this journey.  We’ll also work to equip each other with resources and hope to spark further conversations in our nuclear 
families as well as our church family.  For more information, or for handouts from previous sessions, talk to Ryan Cummins,
