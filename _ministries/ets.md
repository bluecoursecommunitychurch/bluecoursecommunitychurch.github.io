Equipping the Saints (ETS) is a pre-service opportunity to encourage one another in spiritual growth. These sessions begin 
at 9 AM on Sundays.

How can we be “doers of the Word” and not just hearers? How can we live out our faith in our everyday lives? Equipping the 
Saints is designed to give you the skills and principles you need to do just that through interaction and an emphasis on 
application. A guiding passage for our time is found in Ephesians 4:11-16.

## Summer 2023
Equipping the Saints is on summer break and will resume in the fall.
