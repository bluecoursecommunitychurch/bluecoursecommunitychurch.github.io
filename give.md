## [Give Online](https://tithe.ly/give?c=1375190)
[Give online through the Tithe.ly service](https://tithe.ly/give?c=1375190).

Most convenient but with a cost:
* 2.9% + $0.30 for debit/credit
* 1% + $0.30 directly from bank

Click the "Give Online" link or download the free Tithe.ly app from your phone's App Store.

## Write a check

It will cost you an envelope and a stamp or time to drop it in one of the collection boxes, but we all know how to do this.

## Electronic check directly from your bank

Great option if you do online banking.  Simply add name and address of church and the bank will send a check to the church. 
Give once or setup recurring gifts.  (No cost)
