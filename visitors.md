# Newcomer Connections

State College is a community with people of all ages that come and go.  Therefore, we at Blue Course Community Church believe 
that it is important that you feel welcome and have ways to connect with us. Below are some ways that you can connect with us.

## Newcomer Lunch
Held once every few months after our worship service.  A complimentary lunch is provided. This is a wonderful opportunity to 
meet the staff and other leaders at Blue Course Community Church.  You will also be able to hear our vision and find out how 
you can plug-in here. 
 
## Other Ways to Get Connected:
* [Join a Life Group](/ministries/life-groups/)
* Become a Member

## Church Email and Prayer Chain
Our church also communicates a couple of times each week by email. If you would like to be added to our email list, please send 
a request to [church@scefc.org](mailto:church@scefc.org).

## Church Mailbox
We have church mailboxes in our main hallway across from the church office.  Church attendees use their mailboxes to 
communicate about graduation parties, mission trips, etc. Please also email the office if you are interested in having a 
church mailbox.

# What to Expect
* Friendly but not overly aggressive people who will greet you with a smile, a firm handshake and an "I am glad you are here"
* A hot cup of coffee or tea as you mingle with others during our Café Connections time
* Helpful volunteers who will answer your questions and direct you to where you need to go
* Caring, skilled teachers and nursery workers to help care for your children
* Fun, interactive youth classes to help engage your teens
* Contemporary music to aid in your worship of God
* Passionate, practical instruction from God’s Word
* You will be greeted at the door, which could be the one closest to the parking lot. 

The parking lot door is locked is locked after service begins to enhance the safety and security of the children in the 
Education wing. After 10:45, please use the office doors.

## The Sunday service itself looks like this:

Shortly before the service starts, there is instrumental music. This is when you’ll see folks moving from the community room 
and lobby into the sanctuary.

At 10:30, the worship team will begin with one contemporary worship song. The worship leader may read a passage of scripture 
with themes tied to the sermon and music. Lyrics for the songs are projected onto the front wall.

After the first song, the congregation, both in person and online, is welcomed to the service, a few announcements are 
highlighted (with more in the bulletin and even more in the weekly Flock Talk newsletter).

Newer folk are also expressly welcomed and you don’t have to stand or wave or anything. That's one of the benefits of being 
a smaller congregation. Most everyone knows most everyone and folks around you will welcome you more personally. We even have 
a gift packet for you!

After this 5 minute welcome time, the worship team will lead the congregation in a few more songs.

There is usually some kind of "special" after the music. One week might be the monthly Children's Message. Another might be 
the Missionary of the Month (focusing on one of the missionaries we support) or Ministry of the Month (focusing on an 
internal ministry). Occasionally, there’s a presentation from one of the outside ministries we support.

After the music (and Children's Message, if it’s that week), the children are dismissed to Children's Church.

The speaker then delivers the message.

Most weeks, the message is part of a series taken from a book of the Bible that we’re working through. The scripture is read 
and explained as needed (stuff like historical context, customs and language we might not understand just from reading the 
text) and wrapped up with encouragements and suggestions on how to put the principles in the passage into action.

We generally don’t do topical studies, per se, but deal with those various topics as they occur in the passages we're covering 
as they come up.

Then, usually the first Sunday of the month, we celebrate the Lord's Table (or Communion). We hold an open communion, 
meaning that if you are a Believer, you are welcome to participate; you don’t have to be a member of our congregation. If you 
are not yet a Believer, we ask that you let the elements pass by and simply observe. Communion is a celebration not only of 
what Jesus has done for us, but also our unity with Him and with each other as members of the Body of Christ (the 
Church Universal, or capital "C" church), and as such, something quite special.

The elements, bread and grape juice, are served to each person wishing to participate. Pre-packaged elements are available at 
the door when you walk in. Gluten free options are served as well. Used cups are disposed of in the trash can at the doors as 
you exit.

The service is concluded with another worship song.

Folks are free to leave or hang around and chat after service.

Don't worry about trying to remember all of this either! The service leaders are good about giving guidance, knowing that 
there are often new folks with us.
