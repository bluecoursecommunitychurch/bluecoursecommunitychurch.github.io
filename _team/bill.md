![Bill](/images/team/bill-shadow.png)

Bill grew up in western Pennsylvania and attended a United Methodist church throughout his childhood, gaining knowledge about the Bible from the pastors and teachers there. As a college student at Penn State, he met some dedicated and joyful believers and came to realize that he had not fully committed himself to Jesus Christ; He gave his life to Him as a sophomore and became very active in campus ministry. Since then it has been his desire to serve in areas where God has given him skills or strong interests, including musical worship, missions, and ministry to college students. Bill enjoys serving on the churchâ€™s worship, missions, and facilities teams and as a campus ministry affiliate at Penn State.
