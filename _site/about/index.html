<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>

<p>To glorify God by growing a life-changing community of fully devoted Christ-followers in the Centre region and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="our-vision">Our Vision</h2>

<p><strong>At Blue Course Community Church, we desire:</strong></p>

<p>To Become A Transformational Community Of Fully-Devoted Christ Followers Reflecting Him To The World</p>

<p>A transformational community  is a group of people who love God, His family, and His mission as they together experience 
the life-changing message of the Gospel.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, as a transformational community, we are called to:</strong></p>

<p>Love God, which is a response to His love for us (I John 4:19). As we abide in Christ (John 15:4 ), we will experience a 
growing relationship with Him. Our love for God will attract people of all ages to love God above all else.</p>

<p>Love His Family, which is vitally linked to our love for God (I John 4:20-21) and is our most powerful witness to the 
world (John 13:35). We will love and serve one another by putting other’s interests above our own (Phil. 2:3-11).</p>

<p>Love His Mission, which is an overflow of loving Him and His family (John 1:35-42, Luke 15:1-10). We will love and embrace 
His mission by welcoming and sharing the love of Christ with our neighbors, including local families and the international 
community at our doorstep.</p>

<h1 id="strategic-initiatives">Strategic Initiatives</h1>

<h2 id="in-our-transformational-community">IN OUR TRANSFORMATIONAL COMMUNITY…</h2>

<h3 id="we-worship-god-together">…WE ‘WORSHIP GOD TOGETHER’</h3>

<p>Blue Course Community Church considers worship to be intentionally giving glory to God in response to who He is and what 
He has done. We worship God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We understand God created us for relationship with Him and 
one another, so in response to His love, we intentionally show our love for Him through worship. We encourage individuals 
to glorify God in all they say and do. On Sunday mornings, we worship together as a transformational community. We do 
this through vocal praise, prayer, giving, the sacraments, and by engaging in Bible-based teaching. Our goal is to equip 
and encourage all members to grow in their devotion to Christ, and to reflect Him to the world.</p>

<h3 id="we-experience-life-change-through-relationships">…WE EXPERIENCE LIFE CHANGE THROUGH RELATIONSHIPS</h3>

<p>Blue Course Community is a local church community which exists to discover, encourage, and support Jesus’ life-changing 
message for everyone. We believe transformation happens in and through relationships, and these are best formed and 
strengthened within a Christ-centered community. Beyond weekly worship, we emphasize regular community engagement in life 
groups, small groups, or ministry teams. These groups gather for Bible study, prayer, discipleship, fellowship, service, 
and outreach. Participants in these groups develop and grow their faith as they share life experiences with each other. We 
recognize that the church is healthy and growing when every part of His church body does its own special work. We strive to 
equip and resource all members of the body to discover and use their gifts in love and service.</p>

<h3 id="we-are-family-focused">…WE ARE ‘FAMILY FOCUSED’</h3>

<p>Blue Course Community recognizes the significance of God’s family in His design for relational commitment and personal 
development. We seek to be a family-centric community that integrates all individuals throughout our local church body. We 
are committed to investing in strong, vibrant, gospel-focused ministries for children, youth, and adults. Specifically for 
our families, we seek to equip and support parents in raising their children, and to provide appropriate opportunities to 
integrate spiritual development, service, and outreach.</p>

<h3 id="we-have-a-mission-of-outreach">…WE HAVE A ‘MISSION OF OUTREACH’</h3>

<p>Blue Course Community embraces Christ’s mission for the transformational renewal of lives through the Gospel. We are 
committed to intentional outreach, and this mission permeates all our ministries. We encourage individuals to reach out to 
others within their sphere of influence. As a congregation, we emphasize three main outreach efforts. First, we specifically 
seek to serve, love, and reach our neighbors, and the families who live close to our facility. Second, recognizing our 
proximity to Penn State, we specifically seek to reach out to international students, visiting scholars, and their 
families. Third, we will support specific ministry partners who focus on outreach. We seek to engage, welcome, and integrate 
each of these into our community. As a congregation, we will equip, train, and support individuals, small groups, and 
ministry teams for outreach, supporting them with our facilities, finances, prayers, and time.</p>
